I'm a product manager, software engineer and computer scientist, with a career spanning multiple startups and publicly traded companies. My mission has consistently revolved around delivering transformative tools for developers, including in the realms of API management, data & application integration, microservices, and most recently event-driven applications on Kubernetes. 

I hold a Ph.D. in computer science from l’Institut Mines-Télécom, specializing in formal methods for concurrent systems. 

I'm the co-author of the O'Reilly [Kubernetes Cookbook 2nd Edition](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/kubernetes-cookbook-2nd/9781098142230/), scheduled for release in Q4 2023.
