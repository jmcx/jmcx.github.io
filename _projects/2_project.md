I was lucky to collaborate with Sebastien Goasguen (co-founder of TriggerMesh, and much more) and Sameer Naik (one of the early pioneers in containerisation technologies) on the second edition of this book that is a great starting point for those looking to either operate Kubernetes or deploy cloud-native applications. 

At the time of writing the early release can be found [on the O'Reilly platform](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/kubernetes-cookbook-2nd/9781098142230/), the production release is scheduled for Q4 2023.
